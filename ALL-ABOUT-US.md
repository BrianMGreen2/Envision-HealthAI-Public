# 🧠 EnvisionHealth: Governance-First AI for Healthcare

Welcome to the public repository of **EnvisionHealth**, a project focused on developing ethical, explainable, and patient-centric AI solutions to transform healthcare experiences and outcomes.

## 🌟 Our Mission

We believe the future of healthcare AI should be **inclusive**, **transparent**, and **governed responsibly**. EnvisionHealth builds tools that center the patient while supporting providers, payors, and regulators with clear, interpretable, and trustworthy AI systems.

## 🎯 Why This Matters

Too often, AI in healthcare is optimized for system efficiency—**not people**. EnvisionHealth is here to change that by:

- Prioritizing patient needs in every decision
- Building explainability layers tailored for diverse stakeholders (patients, clinicians, payors, regulators)
- Auditing outputs through rigorous, real-world red-teaming and governance strategies
