# 🤝 Patient-Centric AI in Healthcare

At EnvisionHealth, we believe the future of healthcare AI must be built **with patients, for patients**. Our approach centers on aligning every AI solution we create with the values, needs, and lived experiences of the individuals and communities we serve.

## 🌟 What We Mean by "Patient-Centric"

A patient-centric AI system is one that:

- **Enhances, rather than replaces**, the patient-clinician relationship
- Respects **individual preferences, cultural context, and autonomy**
- Offers **explainable insights** that patients can understand and trust
- Prioritizes **data dignity** and **consent** at every stage of the AI lifecycle

## 🧭 Our Guiding Principles

1. **Transparency**
   - Plain-language model explanations and intended use cases
   - Clear documentation of data sources and model limitations

2. **Trustworthiness**
   - Rigorous testing for bias, accuracy, and unintended harms
   - Human-in-the-loop oversight for all high-impact applications

3. **Informed Collaboration**
   - Tools designed to empower shared decision-making
   - Interfaces tailored for both patients and clinicians

4. **Data Stewardship**
   - Use of privacy-preserving techniques (e.g., federated learning, de-ID)
   - Commitment to FAIR and TRUST principles in data management

## 🧠 Design in Action: What It Looks Like

| Feature | Patient-Centric Outcome |
|--------|--------------------------|
| Personalized summaries of visit notes | Improves understanding and adherence |
| Goal-based health planning tools | Aligns care with individual priorities |
| Risk scores with context + explanation | Builds trust and supports action |
| Respectful language and tone checks | Reduces anxiety and increases usability |

## 🫂 Why This Matters

Too often, AI in healthcare is designed around system efficiency or provider convenience. At EnvisionHealth, we believe real innovation happens when we design around the **patient’s lived experience**—because when patients feel seen, heard, and understood, outcomes improve.
